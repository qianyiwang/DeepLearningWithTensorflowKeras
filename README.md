# Hand Writing Recognition Using Deep Learning Method
## Framework: Tensorflow, Keras

Keras has become so popular, that it is now a superset, included with TensorFlow releases now! If you're familiar with Keras previously, you can still use it, but now you can use tensorflow.keras to call it. By that same token, if you find example code that uses Keras, you can use with the TensorFlow version of Keras too. In fact, you can just do something like:
```
import tensorflow.keras as keras
```
